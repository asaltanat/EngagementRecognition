Engagement Recognition using Keras

- MainCode.ipynb : main code with conv layers + dense layers -> accuracy:69.2
- 75ConvLSTM.ipynb: code with Conv1D + LSTM + dense layers
- 75LSTMs.ipynb: code with LSTM+dense layers
- 75onlyDense.ipynb : code with only dense layers
- ASD_36_res1: private dataset Openpose keypoints collected from video
- var : also dataset file but not used in code


- This codes were written in Anaconda 1.7.2 jupyter notebook. 
  In order to run it you should have environment with installed machine learning and deep learning libraries like keras, tensorflow
  Other libraries also may be needed.

* It was written from scratch and many libraries were reinstalled according to errors that we had during the coding process, therefore
  if you have errors when you run just google your error and do what is needed.
* Some of the imported libraries may not be needed, because we have used different architecture and imported many libraries (like torch)
